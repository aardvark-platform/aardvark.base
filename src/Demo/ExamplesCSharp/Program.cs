/* 

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to use the aardvark base libraries in C#.
C# and F# both compile to IL and therefore compose to some degree, i.e. libraries can be used
in both directions.
Aardvark.Base is somewhat special because it makes heavy use of F# features which have no direct
C# equivalent (except for boilderplate). 
Additionally, our C# interfaces for F# datatypes often lack convenience and C# idiomatic API (
(are not always as complete as the real implementation).
One goal of this file is to show the very basic interaction techniques and motivate developers to
contribute to the convenience layers to C#.
