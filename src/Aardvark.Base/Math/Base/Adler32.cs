    /// compute.
    /// 
    /// The specification for Adler32 may be found in RFC 1950.
    /// 
    /// 
    /// From that document:
    /// 
    ///  "ADLER32 (Adler-32 checksum)
    ///   This contains a checksum value of the uncompressed data
    ///   (excluding any dictionary data) computed according to Adler-32
    ///   algorithm. This algorithm is a 32-bit extension and improvement
    ///   of the Fletcher algorithm, used in the ITU-T X.224 / ISO 8073
    ///   standard.
    /// 
    ///   Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: s1 is
    ///   the sum of all bytes, s2 is the sum of all s1 values. Both sums
    ///   are done modulo 65521. s1 is initialized to 1, s2 to zero.  The
    ///   Adler-32 checksum is stored as s2*65536 + s1 in most-
    ///   significant-byte first (network) order."
    /// 
    ///  "8.2. The Adler-32 algorithm
    /// 
    ///    The Adler-32 algorithm is much faster than the CRC32 algorithm yet
    ///    still provides an extremely low probability of undetected errors.
    /// 
    ///    The modulo on unsigned long accumulators can be delayed for 5552
    ///    bytes, so the modulo operation time is negligible.  If the bytes
    ///    are a, b, c, the second sum is 3a + 2b + c + 3, and so is position
    ///    and order sensitive, unlike the first sum, which is just a
    ///    checksum.  That 65521 is prime is important to avoid a possible
    ///    large class of two-byte errors that leave the check unchanged.
    ///    (The Fletcher checksum uses 255, which is not prime and which also
    ///    makes the Fletcher check insensitive to single byte changes 0 -
    ///    255.)
    /// 
    ///    The sum s1 is initialized to 1 instead of zero to make the length
    ///    of the sequence part of s2, so that the length does not have to be
    ///    checked separately. (Any sequence of zeroes has a Fletcher
    ///    checksum of zero.)"
